# E-Commerce-Backend

## About the Project
This project entailed completing the back-end for an e-commerce site using the following: Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, MySQL database. Starter code was provided by Xandromus (https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella) with missing code from the following locations: models, routes and associations, and importing/syncing sequelize models in server.js. The application also demonstrates API routes to perform RESTful CRUD operations.

## The Build Requirements
### User Story

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

## Applied Skills
- Setting up a connection to Sequelize for communication with MySQL database
